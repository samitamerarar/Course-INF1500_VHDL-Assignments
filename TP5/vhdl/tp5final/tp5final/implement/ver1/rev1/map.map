Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   324 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 324
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        712 out of  28,800    2%
    Number used as logic:                      703 out of  28,800    2%
      Number using O6 output only:             469
      Number using O5 output only:             210
      Number using O5 and O6:                   24
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         9
  Number of route-thrus:                       219
    Number using O6 output only:               219

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   249 out of   7,200    3%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          737
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           413 out of     737   56%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  25 out of     737    3%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         299 out of     737   40%
    Number of unique control sets:              32
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              72 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        25 out of     480    5%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       25 out of      25  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.17

Peak Memory Usage:  556 MB
